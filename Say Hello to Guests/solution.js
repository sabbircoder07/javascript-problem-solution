/*
Say Hello to Guests

In this exercise you will have to:

Take a list of names.
Add "Hello" to every name.
Make one big string with all greetings.
The solution should be one string with a comma in between every "Hello (Name)".

Examples
greetPeople(["Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Joe"

greetPeople(["Angela", "Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Angela, Hello Joe"

greetPeople(["Frank", "Angela", "Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Frank, Hello Angela, Hello Joe"
Notes
Each greeting has to be separated with a comma and a space.
If you're given an empty array [], return an empty string "".

function greetPeople(names) {
  let myGreetPeople = "";
  if (names.length === 0) {
    myGreetPeople = `""`;
  } else {
    myGreetPeople = names.map((x) => "Hello" + " " + x).join(", ");
  }

  return myGreetPeople;
}

console.log(greetPeople([]));
